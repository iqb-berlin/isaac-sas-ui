# ISAAC User Interface for Model Training and Prediction

This repository provides a Web User Interface that makes it possible to use the ISAAC ML Service.

It provides the following functionalities:

1. Training a new Model
2. Predicting from an Existing Model

## Usage

Open `web_interface.html` in a web browser and make sure that the ISAAC ML service is running.

## File Input for Training

The input files for training must be in a specified TSV format.  
The CSV input will then be converted to ShortAnswerInstances.

## Send ShortAnswerInstances Directly From JSON File

This feature has not yet been implemented but it might be handy to send ShortAnswerInstances directly.
